# odin-recipes
My first odin project
Project: Recipes, Foundation Course. 

In this project I am going to build a basic recipe website. 

This project will consist of a main page which will have links to a few different recipes.

This project will focus on html, setting up a repository on github and moving the repository to my local machine.
